This is the video I am talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e75bHGkwjBs - it is of 2 boys fighting outdoors (it is said that it happened in Istora Senayan).

What I learned after watching the video above:

* It is _never_ okay to record a portrait video. Always do landscape. Don't be that dumbass who wastes 2/3 of the screen.
* When recording something, unless it is a howto video or any other that requires your narration, shut the fuck up. If you're not the content, you're the noise.
* I didn't know you could record videos on potato quality.
* Real life fights don't look as pretty as the movies make them.
* The "thud" noise I expected when a punch lands sounds a bit like wet slap.
* Balance is important when fighting. Failing to maintain it was the biggest mistake the douche in white made. The fat douche in black easily overpowered him, gravity was his ally.
* Proper footworks makes you move like the guys in boxing match, improper one makes you look like dirty dancing with your opponent.
* Winning instantly validates your argument.
* Participating in a fight apparently rise your rank in the douche club.

`<sarcasm>`Glad the fight wasn't for nothing and they've resolved whatever argument it was they had.`</sarcasm>`
