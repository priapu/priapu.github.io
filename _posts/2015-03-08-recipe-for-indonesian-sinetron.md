If you've been watching Indonesian soap operas (dubbed sinetron by the locals), then you know for a fact that a recipe for a successful sinetron is as follows.

### Ingredients:

* Overly religious people.
* Extremely poor people befriending extremely rich people.
* And then they fall in love but their families are totally against it.
* Kids with super strength.
* A whiny transvestite.
* Mythical creatures such as werewolves and vampires (even though they aren't native Indonesian creatures).
* Big animals with kids riding them. E.g. dragons and komodos.
* People with speech impediment. Most of the time they are the only source of comedy.
* Muscular people who are stupid beyond imagination. Another source of comedy, the bigger the dumber the better.
* Stereotypical Betawi people who are always, _always_ obnoxiously loud and insult people for fun.
* Super cute poor boys and girls who work shitty job for living. E.g. bajaj driver or nasi goreng seller.
* People losing memories by bumping their head somewhere.
* Peopel gaining lost memories by bumping their head somewhere. Again.
* People coming out of plastic surgeries looking nothing like they used to. Sometimes even the whole body features change.
* People waking up with perfect hair and make up.
* Cars that are easily sabotaged, typically their brake will fail.
* People staring at other people or at nothing.
* While thinking out loud.
* While making weird facial expression.
* Zoom in and out of the above scene, viewers love it.
* Incompetent nurses who let babies get swapped.
* "Borrow" superheroes. Surely Hollywood wouldn't mind.

But srsly.

### How to cook it:

* Randomly take some (or all!) of the ingredients above.
* Send it to one of the Punjabis.
* Profit!

You can thank me later when you're rich.
