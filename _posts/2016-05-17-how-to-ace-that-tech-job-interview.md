* Have a skill that shows depth, but don't make it all you're about.
* Have online presence. Contribute to open source projects.
* Make a habit of improvement.
* Learn something new every week. You don't always have to master a new thing every week but try to keep up with the trend.
* Be polite, concise, and timely. Manners matter under any circumstances.
* Ask the right questions.

That's the TL;DR version of it, now if you have more time..

#### Show depth, but don't make it all you're about

If you already excel at one thing, keep advertising it but don't stop there. You should also have *some* depth about other things as well.

You could be an experienced Java programmer, but it adds so much value to yourself if you also know Javascript for example.

Spend some time to learn other languages and frameworks, see what they do differently and why. It is always a good insight.

#### Be polite, concise, and timely

This should go without saying as this is basic ethics. If the interview is set at noon, show up 10 minutes before. If it's via Skype, make sure you add the other party's ID before the meeting starts, also try to be on good internet.

If it's far, calculate your travel time. ***Don't blame traffic***.

Be polite in all communication, treat people the way you want to be treated.

Technical skills can be taught, but *assholes are hard to change*.

#### Have online presence

People *will* look your name up. Nothing disappears from the internet, so make sure you're SEO-optimised.

Write good LinkedIn profile, have a blog that discusses whatever interests you, contribute to open source projects, answer questions on StackOverflow/Quora.

#### Ask the right questions

You will be given a chance to ask questions too, the interview won't be one-sided. If it is, you should be proactive and ask questions anyway.

Do ask the coding standard used. Do ask if we're doing code reviews. Do ask if we're test-driven. Do ask if we're our tests are automated. Do ask if we have mentors in-house.

Do ask questions that tells us that you did your homework.

Do ask questions that show your depth, that you're passionate about the work.

Do ask questions that show that you're hungry for knowledge.

Bottom line is that interviewers won't only assess your technical side. The more experience you have in the field, the more likely you'll be assessed by your attitude as well.

*So be cool, don't be an asshole.*
