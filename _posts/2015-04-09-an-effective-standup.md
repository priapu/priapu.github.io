* Surprisingly, `stand the hell up`. It keeps you awake.
* Only one person may talk at a time. We can try to enforce this by using a token, here we use a ball. Only the person who holds the ball may talk.
* Stick to the format:
  * What you did yesterday.
  * What you plan to do today.
  * What's blocking you from doing your task, if any.
* If anything comes up during the standup, the scrum master takes note of that and make separate discussion after the standup.
