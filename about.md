![Pria](/images/profile_picture.jpg "Pria")

Hi, I'm Pria. I started in tech over a decade ago. My skillset includes product development, technical leadership, and making things work between business and tech. I work for [Kata.ai](https://kata.ai/), at the moment based primarily in Jakarta.

More about me can be found at my [LinkedIn page](http://id.linkedin.com/in/priapurnama/). I can also be found talking about software engineering and leadership (when not making bad jokes) on my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/anima).
